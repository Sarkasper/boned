# Boned

## About Boned?

Boned is a boilerplate that can help you easily design websites that look beautiful 
at any size, be it a laptop screen, tablet or smartphone. It's based on a responsive 
grid, but also provides very basic CSS for typography, buttons, forms and media queries.  
  
  
### Reason

One of my favourite boilerplates to work with is Skeleton[0] but it seems 
outdated. The last commit was in 2012, it still uses Reset CSS instead 
of Normalize.css and some other older compatibility practises.  
After some research it seems that HTML5 Boilerplate[1] is more what I am 
looking for but it is missing some of the responsive layout features I 
liked in Skeleton[0].  
So I decided to create my own based on them, combining the simplicity and modern 
approach of HTML5 Boilerplate[1] and the beautiful responsive layout of 
Skeleton[0].
