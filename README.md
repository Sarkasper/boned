## About Boned?

Boned is a boilerplate that can help you easily design websites that look beautiful 
at any size, be it a laptop screen, tablet or smartphone. It is based on a responsive 
grid, but also provides very basic CSS for typography, buttons, forms and media queries.


### Reason

One of my favourite boilerplates to work with is [Skeleton](www.getskeleton.com) but 
it seems outdated. The last commit was in 2012, it still uses [Reset CSS](http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/) 
instead of [Normalize.css](http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) 
<sup>[1](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6887336/what-is-the-difference-between-normalize-css-and-reset-css)</sup> 
and some other older compatibility practises.  
After some research it seems that [HTML5 Boilerplate](www.html5boilerplate.com) is 
more what I am looking for but it is missing some of the responsive layout features 
I liked in [Skeleton](www.getskeleton.com).  
So I decided to create my own based on them, combining the simplicity and modern 
approach of [HTML5 Boilerplate](www.html5boilerplate.com) and the beautiful responsive 
layout of [Skeleton](www.getskeleton.com).
