A responsive boilerplate for easy website design.

Reason
======

One of my favourite boilerplates to work with is Skeleton[0] but it seems 
outdated (last commit was in 2012).  
After some research it seems that HTML5 Boilerplate[1] is more what I am 
looking for but it is missing some of the responsive layout features I 
liked in Skeleton[0].  
So I decided to create my own based on them, the simplicity and modern 
approach of HTML5 Boilerplate[1] and the beautiful responsive layout of 
Skeleton[0].
